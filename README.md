# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: Looks good<p>
* Question 3: Good<p>
* Question 4: This works, though I'd encourage you to consider the units of measurement for these. Rain is in mm, for example, so a 1 unit increase isn't very much.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: The pop variable did change a fair amount, but this works.<p>
* Question 7: Missing the map for this question.<p>
* Question 8: Also missing the bptest for heteroskedasticity here.<p>
* Question 9: What are the results? How would you explain the big picture story to someone wondering what influences NDVI?<p>
* Challenge: You're most of the way there on this, but the interpretation of the model results needs work. If the coefficients are positive, it means that NDVI went down over this 20 year span if that variable also went down. Also pay attention to what's significant here--can't say much about the variables that aren't.<p>
<p>
General feedback: Incomplete--there's missing items in Q7 and Q8 and more needed in Q9 and the challenge.
